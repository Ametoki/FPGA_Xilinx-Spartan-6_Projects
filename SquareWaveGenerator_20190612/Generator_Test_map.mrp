Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   291 out of  11,440    2%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 291

    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      1,168 out of   5,720   20%
    Number used as logic:                    1,156 out of   5,720   20%
      Number using O6 output only:             726
      Number using O5 output only:             102
      Number using O5 and O6:                  328
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     12
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:        12
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       780 out of   2,860   27%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,276
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           994 out of   1,276   77%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 108 out of   1,276    8%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         174 out of   1,276   13%
    Number of unique control sets:              14
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              69 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        21 out of     186   11%
